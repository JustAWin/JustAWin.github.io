<h1><center>Hello World!</center></h1>
<p>My name is Justin Nguyen. I am a current undergraduate student at <br>
The University of Texas at Austin. I am majoring in Astronomy and Physics with a concentration <br>
in Biophysics and Radiation Physics. I am working on the Business Foundations and <br>
Elements of Computing certificates. I am also minoring in German.</p>
<p>This is my website where there will be links to my various profiles, curriculum vitae and résumé. <br>
I will update the site from time to time and will archive old versions for nostalgia. The site will be available in English and German.
